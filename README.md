# Code-for-Radio-Channel-Measurements-in-D2X-Communication-

This project implements a wireless measurement setup where transmitters send short Zadoffâ€“Chu (ZC) sounding sequences at random intervals following a Poisson process. Each transmission lasts 5 ms and contains two alternating ZC sequences: one reference and one shifted by a node-specific offset for identification. The system operates using a pure ALOHA protocol with no scheduling or channel sensing, relying on short bursts and low traffic to minimize collisions. On the receiver side, a matched filter detects incoming sequences and identifies transmitters based on peak spacing, while an embedded Python block logs metadata such as sender, receiver, timestamp, and received power. Collisions are detected when the peak spacing deviates from the expected pattern, and corrupted transmissions are discarded.
